# Jamesâ€™s Portfolio

I am an Art major at [Cal State Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/) who plans to graduate in 2027. I took CPSC 120 since I was somewhat interested in programming and have always considered it as an alternative career path if art or animation doesn't work out so well.

# Favorite Labs from CPSC 120L

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-james-tom-1)

Lab 4 was great because it was one of our first experiences with functions, as well as one of the first experiences with boolean values. This lab provided a basic overview of these two very important concepts and it was very fun to learn.


* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-james-bryan/tree/main)

Lab 6 was a lab I enjoyed a lot since part 2, the blackjack program, was one of the programs that I really had to spend a lot of time on. Surprisingly, working slowly through the blackjack programs to make it function was very fun, and was very satisfying to finally finish.


* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-james-and-richard)

Lab 10 introduced file stream input, which was very fun to play around with. Additionally, I started feeling like I was mastering loops and getting a better understanding of computer programming, so it was very satisfying to feel that.
