# Jamesâ€™s Portfolio

I am an Art major who plans to graduate in 2027. I took CPSC 120 since I was somewhat interested in programming and have always considered it as an alternative career path if art or animation doesn't work out so well.

# Favorite Labs

1. Lab 4

Lab 4 was great because it was one of our first experiences with functions, as well as one of the first experiences with boolean values. This lab provided a basic overview of these two very important concepts and it was very fun to learn.

2. Lab 6

3. Lab 10
