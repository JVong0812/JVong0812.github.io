# Jamesâ€™s Portfolio

I am an Art major who plans to graduate in 2027. I took CPSC 120 since I was somewhat interested in programming and have always considered it as an alternative career path if art or animation doesn't work out so well.

# Favorite Labs

1. Lab 4

Lab 4 was great because it was one of our first experiences with functions, as well as one of the first experiences with boolean values. This lab provided a basic overview of these two very important concepts and it was very fun to learn.


2. Lab 6

Lab 6 was a lab I enjoyed a lot since part 2, the blackjack program, was one of the programs that I really had to spend a lot of time on. Surprisingly, working slowly through the blackjack programs to make it function was very fun, and was very satisfying to finally finish.


3. Lab 10

Lab 10 introduced file stream input, which was very fun to play around with. Additionally, I started feeling like I was mastering loops and getting a better understanding of computer programming, so it was very satisfying to feel that.
